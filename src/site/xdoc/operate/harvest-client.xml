<!-- ========================================================== -->

<subsection name="Quick Start">


<!-- ==================== -->
<h4>Configuration File</h4>
<p>
Harvest client requires message broker (RabbitMQ) connection to submit jobs to the Harvest server cluster.
Default configuration file, <i>&lt;INSTALL_DIR&gt;/conf/harvest-client.cfg</i>, has the following parameters:
</p>

<source>
# Message server type. Currently, only 'RabbitMQ' is supported.
mq.type = RabbitMQ

# RabbitMQ host(s). One or more host:port tuples (one tuple per line).
rmq.host = localhost:5672

# RabbitMQ user
rmq.user = harvest

# RabbitMQ password
rmq.password = harvest
</source>

<p>
You may need to update RabbitMQ host, user and password.
</p>

<!-- ==================== -->
<h4>View Help</h4>

<p>
To print usage information, run <i>harvest-client</i> without any parameters:
</p>

<source>
&lt;INSTALL_DIR&gt;/bin/harvest-client
</source>

<source>
Usage: harvest-client &lt;command&gt; &lt;options&gt;

Commands:
  harvest         Submit new harvest job
  -V, --version   Print Harvest Client version

Options:
  -v &lt;value&gt;   Log verbosity: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR. Default is INFO.
  -help        Pass -help after any command to see command-specific usage information, for example,
               harvest-client harvest -help

</source>

<p>
To see help for the "harvest" command, run:
</p>

<source>
&lt;INSTALL_DIR&gt;/bin/harvest-client harvest -help
</source>

<source>
Usage: harvest-client harvest &lt;options&gt;

Submit new harvest job

Required parameters:
  -j &lt;path&gt;   Harvest job file

Optional parameters:
  -c &lt;path&gt;    Harvest Client configuration file. Default is $HARVEST_CLIENT_HOME/conf/harvest.cfg
  -overwrite   Overwrite registered products
</source>

<!-- ==================== -->
<h4>Submit a Job</h4>

<p>
To submit a job to the harvest server cluster you need a job configuration file. 
An example configuration file is available in the installation directory:
<i>&lt;INSTALL_DIR&gt;/examples/directories.xml</i>. 
</p>

<p>
You will need to update the nodeName:
<source>
&lt;harvest nodeName="PDS_ATM"&gt;
</source>

The path to the data:
<source>
  &lt;directories&gt;
    &lt;path&gt;/data/OREX/orex_spice&lt;/path&gt;
  &lt;/directories&gt;
</source>
  
And the URL prefix for the data:
<source>
  &lt;fileInfo&gt;
    &lt;!-- UPDATE with your own local path and base url where pds4 archive are published --&gt;
    &lt;fileRef replacePrefix="/data" with="https://pds-atmospheres.nmsu.edu/" /&gt;
  &lt;/fileInfo&gt;
</source>
</p>

<p>
If you save this file as <i>/tmp/job1.xml</i> and run Harvest Client
<source>
&lt;INSTALL_DIR&gt;/bin/harvest-client harvest -j /tmp/job1.xml
</source>
</p>
<p>
You should see output similar to this:
<source>
[INFO] Reading job from /tmp/job1.xml
[INFO] Reading configuration from /tmp/big-data-harvest-client-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT/conf/harvest-client.cfg
[INFO] Creating new job...
[INFO] Connecting to RabbitMQ
[INFO] Created job f282a012-115e-429c-b445-f5eed1d81303
</source>
</p>

<h4>Next Steps</h4>
<p>
Monitor RabbitMQ, Crawler, Harvest, and Elasticsearch servers for progress of your job.
